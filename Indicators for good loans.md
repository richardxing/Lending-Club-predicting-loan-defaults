This is a heatmap plot for the correlation between features of loans. 
The correlation between FICO credit score and defaults on loans(or Good Loans) is surprisingly large (0.55 and 0.6), 
as a matter of fact, it's much larger than the correlation between interest rate and defaults(0.2), which is surprising.

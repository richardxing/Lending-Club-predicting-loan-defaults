## explanation for plot 1

This is a heatmap plot for the correlation between features of loans. Good/Bad loans are shown as labels. The correlation between FICO credit
score(last_low_fico_score and last_high_fico_score) and defaults on loans(labels) is surprisingly large, in fact, it's much larger than that between interest rate(int_rate) and defaults. Debt-to-income ratio
(dti) has a much smaller impact on defaulting than expected.

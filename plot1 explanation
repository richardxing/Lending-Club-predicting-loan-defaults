This is a heatmap plot for the correlation between features of loans. Good/Bad loans are shown as labels. The correlation between FICO credit
score and defaults on loans(labels) is surprisingly large, in fact, it's much larger than that between interest rate and defaults. Debt-to-income ratio
(dti) has a much smaller impact on defaulting than expected.

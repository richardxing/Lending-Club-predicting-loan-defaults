## ROC curve

The Receiver Operating Charasteristic(ROC) curve is a common way to assess model performance when the dataset is imbalanced. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) metric is a quantitity that can be used to gauge the performance. Random guess has AUC ~ 0.5 and perfect predictions(which give all correct ranking for labels) has AUC = 1.
